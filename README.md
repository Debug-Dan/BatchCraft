# BatchCraft
BatchCraft is a custom-built Minecraft Launcher for my friends to facilitate modpack updates. BatchCraft was formerly known as UgliLauncher, however it is essentially the same thing but with a new name and various improvements. Feel free to check the code yourself (right click the launcher, then hit edit).
